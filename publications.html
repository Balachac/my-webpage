			Balachandran, C. and Wezel, F.C. (2020). "Employee external affiliation and inter-firm mobility: Evidence from Swedish microdata", Tzabbar, D. and Cirillo, B. (Ed.) Employee Inter- and Intra-Firm Mobility (Advances in Strategic Management, Vol. 41), Emerald Publishing Limited, pp. 197-214.
Abstract. How does having an external affiliation influence the probability of employee inter-firm mobility? Our review of the literature suggests that it is difficult to predict ex-ante whether holding an external affiliation increases or decreases inter-firm mobility due to the presence of competing arguments related to the benefits of employment flexibility against agency costs. In the absence of a clear direction for prediction, we conduct an exploratory analysis on administrative labor market data from Sweden during 2002–2010. Specifically, we examine the effects of a few contingencies that are prominent in the study of employment and organizations, namely, organizational age, size, and employment tenure. We find that holding an external organizational affiliation reduces inter-firm mobility among younger and smaller organizations, and for recent hires; yet it increases inter-firm mobility for other organizations and employees. We discuss the implications of our work for future research.

Abstract. This study explains the conditions under which new venture boards are less or more culturally diverse in terms of their directors' country of birth. Longitudinal data on 5,515 Swedish ventures suggest that most directors are recruited from founders' proximate social settings—neighborhoods in which they reside and past workplaces—and that diversity levels in these social settings strongly predict the national culture diversity in venture boards. Given the rapid internationalization of workplaces and regions around the world, this paper provides important clues regarding how culturally diverse upper echelons are being incorporated into the organizational design of new ventures.

Abstract. Several studies have documented the importance of optimal work situation and the general well-being of early-career researchers (ECRs) for enhancing the academic performance of universities. Yet, most studies focused on specific categories of ECRs, or on specific academic disciplines as well as on specific outcomes. With this study, we recognize the need for a broader sample encompassing different categories of ECRs across academic disciplines. In a national survey of Swedish universities, the National Junior Faculty of Sweden (NJF) collected data from ECRs in order to study the influence of work situation and well-being on perceived scientific environment. We observed that work situation and well-being are interdependent and jointly influence each other in shaping the conditions for ideal scientific environment. Importantly, we employ structural equation model (SEM) analysis to account for the endogenous relationship between work situation and personal well-being in predicting perceived scientific environment. Results from SEM indicate that support from the university, work time management, job clarity, contract length and quality of life satisfaction were related to the perceived possibility of conducting the best science. Our research also highlighted individual differences across demographic factors and contract length in the perceived work situation and the possibility of conducting the best science.

Abstract. Using employer–employee matched data from Sweden between 2001 and 2008, we test hypotheses designed to assess the contingent nature of the relationship between wage dispersion and cross-firm mobility. Whereas past research has mostly established that dispersed wages increase interfirm mobility, we investigate the conditions under which pay variance might have the opposite effect, serving to retain workers. We propose that the effect of wage dispersion is contingent on organizational rank and that it depends on whether wages are dispersed vertically (between job levels) or horizontally (within the same job level). We find that vertical wage dispersion suppresses cross-firm mobility because it is associated with outcomes beneficial for employees, such as attractive advancement opportunities. By contrast, horizontal wage dispersion increases cross-firm mobility because it is associated with outcomes harmful for employees, such as inequity concerns. We further find that the vertical-dispersion effect is amplified (mitigated) for bottom (top) different-level wage earners because bottom (top) wage earners have the most (least) to gain from climbing the job ladder. Similarly, the horizontal-dispersion effect is amplified (mitigated) for bottom (top) same-level wage earners because bottom (top) wage earners are most (least) subject to negative consequences of this dispersion. More broadly, this study contributes to our understanding of the relationship between wage dispersion and cross-firm mobility.

Abstract. Knowledge–based theories of entrepreneurship infer transfer of knowledge from the effect of labor mobility on entrepreneurial entry. Yet, simple selection or situational mechanisms that do not imply knowledge transfer may influence entrepreneurial entry in similar ways. We argue that the extent to which such alternative mechanisms operate, labor mobility predicts entry but not subsequent performance for entrepreneurs. Analyses of matched employee–employer data from Sweden suggest that high rates of geographical and industry mobility increase individuals’ likelihood of entrepreneurial entry but have no effects on their entrepreneurial performance. This indicates that the relationship between labor mobility and entrepreneurial entry do not necessarily imply knowledge transfer.
